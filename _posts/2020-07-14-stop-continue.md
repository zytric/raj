 * Can addictive activites be good for you? 
 * How do you know is something is good or bad for you?

## Definitions
Habbit, behaviour, addiction, routine, reapeated actions. In this post we define these as *activities*. That is, what you do repeatedly.

## ðŸ¥‡ A good activity may bring you
 * Meaning 
 * Physical-, mental-, or spiritual value
 * A feedback loop which makes you improve
 * Opportunity, Money, Living
 * Knowlegde and perspective
 
## ðŸš¨ A bad activity can be
 * Consuming alcohol, coffine, drugs, nicotine, 
 * Consuming unhealthy foods (e.g. suger, saturated fat, processed food)
 * Playing games
 * Watching videos
 * Reading static news
 * Behaving arrogant and recentful
 * Criticizing yourself for doing it
 * Not willing to defend it for yourself or others
 
## Procastination
Not taking a action, may be a bad action. A military commander have a higher risk losing his job by not taking an actions, rather then taking a poor one.

## Acceptance
Your case is special and you know a guy it works well for.
 * "A glass of wine a day is good for you"
 * "Playing video games is fun. There are alot people earning there living on it. I met alot of friends online."

You need to find and accept your bad activities as bad. Stopping them will probably bring you a better outcome than continue with it. A lottery-winner will probably think buying a lottery ticket was a good idÃ©a, while it statistically would be stupid. 

## When to stop?
As a former sky-diver I once asked my mentor. If my altimeter stops working or I can't read it, how long time can I freefall before I pull my parachute? Hanging in the sky at 4000 meters seems to be a risk in it self. My mentor replied.

 > You are running your at your full speed against a wall full of razor sharp nails. Someone turns of the light. How long will you continue before stop?

It's an intersting anecdote. If I am watching TV everyday. How long time will it take before something bad happens? When will I lose health? when will my relations suffer? When will I fall behind at work from it? You will not know. But. If you continue to fall, you will probably face a consequence. I will give you another sky-dive quote. 

> The only hard-part of sky-diving, is the ground.

## Celebrate
Don't forget to celebrate and reward yourself. Carrot yourself; If I do X, I will Y.
