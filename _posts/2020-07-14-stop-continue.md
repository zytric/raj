## How and when to stop bad behaviour?
Accept the it as bad. A "glass of wine is good for you". Sure. But. No.

As a former sky-diver I once asked my mentor. If my altimeter stops working or I can't read it, how long time can I freefall before I pull my parachute? I mean hanging in the sky at 4000 meters seems to be a risk in it self. My mentor replied...

 > You are running your at your full speed against a wall full of razor sharp nails. Someone turns of the light. How long would you continue to run before you stop?

It's an intersting anecdote. If I am watching TV every day. How long time will it take before something bad happen? When will I lose health? When will I lose my relationship? When will I fall behind at work from it? You not know for sure. But. If you continue to fall we can go back to another sky-diving quote. 

> The only hard-part of sky-diving, is the ground.
