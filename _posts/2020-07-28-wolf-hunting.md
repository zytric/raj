According to a [article](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21228354-700-wolf-packs-dont-need-to-cooperate-to-make-a-kill) a wolf pack can follow simple rules to encircle its prey.

`Raymond Coppinger of Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts, and colleagues modelled a five-strong wolf pack in pursuit of prey. They programmed each wolf to move towards the prey until it reached a certain safe distance. It then moved away from any other wolves that had reached that distance.`

This is two rules:
 * Move towards the prey until it reached a certain safe distance.
 * Then moved away from any other wolves that had reached that distance.
