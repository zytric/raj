My colleague (working as an Test Manager) and I were talking about gaming memories. A couple of minutes later we were battling [C&C](https://www.adityaravishankar.com/projects/games/command-and-conquer) (1997) in the browser. [A guy](https://www.adityaravishankar.com/2011/11/command-and-conquer-programming-an-rts-game-in-html5-and-javascript) had actually recrated the game in HTML5 and JavaScript, impressive. A older version of his source code were available on [github](https://github.com/adityaravishankar/command-and-conquer).

We played a game against each other, multiplayer mode. That was a real retro feeling. However...

*You have lost the match.*
``sounds.play("mission_failure");``

What!? Losing? That sucks.
